for creating react app , we have many ways :
1 > npx create-react-app your_app_name = this is old and heavy way to create react application, no preferred nowdays
2 > use other libraries like vite ,parsel etc
npm create vite@latest or npm create vite(vite with some specified version name)

> For all react app, you need to make sure that component's name should have all or first letter capitalized
> in vite with react, you need to use jsx when you try to use components but in create-react-app -> react app, does not need that
> means required naming file's extension correctly.
> react via vite is Framework whereas react via create-react-app is library
> <></> this empty tag is called fragment in react.

3 > That customReact folder is an attempt to create custom React itself 
> React tries to make a tree of all our element that we use in react
> look into this customReact folder ,it shows real react js working , go look in to it

3.1 > we can use React.createElement() for doing similar things as we were doing in custom react
3.2 > React.createElement() is used in React by default , for all defined elements
3.3 > React.createElement() is injected by Babel behind the scene

4 > In react , we use '{}' inside our tags which we define in jsx file
like 
function App() {
  const username = "Himanshu Gupta !"

  return (
    <>
    <h1>Chai aur React with vite | {username}</h1>
    < Chai />
    </>
  )
}

here , '{}' this is called "expression" in react js
and username which is used there is called "evaluation expression"
5 > Hooks in react are used to update values of variable on UI, since even if we update them UI does not show then thats why we use Hooks in react
some react Hooks are : useState(), useEffect(), useContext() and many more

> The Algorithm that works in react core is called React Fiber.
> previous Algorithm that was working for VirtualDOM had need betterment/improvement like when our UI in react depends on API or any
network related UI, at that if there are multiple updates for it at lag of some seconds or they came at almost instantly, then
react UI work on implementing all of them one by one even though they works for samething, and if we waited a little we could have
gotten last updates and not needed to update each of them

and more more similar issues

so, a new react core's algorithm was implemented on React called as React Fiber.

> The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. 
> Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

> Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; 
> the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

> 'Hyderation' is the process of sending JS code to browser for a page, when other structure like HTML and CSS are already there
> You may have noticed that at the start when react initialized, some button that clicked on does not seems to be working but all of
sudden they started working, yes that was time when JS was loading there  and this process in react is called "HYDERATION".

Reconciliation
> The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
> for difference here means difference between DOM (one tree) in browser and VirtualDOM (another tree) of react 
> Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." ###
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.


> Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, 
> the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same. 
> The key points are:

> - Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. 
> - React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
> - Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

The key points are:

> In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, 
causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
> Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, 
say, an update from a data store.
> A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows 
the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. 
Specifically, we need to be able to

> pause work and come back to it later.
> assign priority to different types of work.
> reuse previously completed work.
>  abort work if it's no longer needed.


After that we just need to learn props in React.

THATS ALL for React FOUNDATION/LEARNING

others like routing etc are extra libraries used in react.
