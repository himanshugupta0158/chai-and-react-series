for creating react app , we have many ways :
1 > npx create-react-app your_app_name = this is old and heavy way to create react application, no preferred nowdays
2 > use other libraries like vite ,parsel etc
npm create vite@latest or npm create vite(vite with some specified version name)

> For all react app, you need to make sure that component's name should have all or first letter capitalized
> in vite with react, you need to use jsx when you try to use components but in create-react-app -> react app, does not need that
> means required naming file's extension correctly.
> react via vite is Framework whereas react via create-react-app is library
> <></> this empty tag is called fragment in react.

3 > That customReact folder is an attempt to create custom React itself 
> React tries to make a tree of all our element that we use in react
> look into this customReact folder ,it shows real react js working , go look in to it

3.1 > we can use React.createElement() for doing similar things as we were doing in custom react
3.2 > React.createElement() is used in React by default , for all defined elements
3.3 > React.createElement() is injected by Babel behind the scene

4 > In react , we use '{}' inside our tags which we define in jsx file
like 
function App() {
  const username = "Himanshu Gupta !"

  return (
    <>
    <h1>Chai aur React with vite | {username}</h1>
    < Chai />
    </>
  )
}

here , '{}' this is called "expression" in react js
and username which is used there is called "evaluation expression"
